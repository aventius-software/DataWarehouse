This is an open source and free to use basic generic SQL Server data warehouse (or it will be ;-)

It mainly consists of the tables, functions, procedures from our blog articles on data warehousing. We hope you like it and feel free to help fork, send a pull request or log any issues you find. It has been designed using Visual Studio 2019 and consists of 2 projects:-

DataWarehouse.Database (this is the main SQL database project) and DataWarehouse.UnitTests (this is the unit test project)

Happy SQL'ing from the folks at Aventius
